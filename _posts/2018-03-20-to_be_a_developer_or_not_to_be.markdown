Why am I learning to be a Web Developer? Easy, its because the field is growing and the pay is great. Why am I learning it now? Well that is a different question altogether but the gist of it is because why not. 

I have always been fond of programming. Having dabbled in web design back in high school and a couple programming classes in college, I always felt that it was an interesting and useful subject to learn. But I never really take a serious interest in it since I liked learning science and especially chemistry more. 

Fast forward several years and there I was a graduate student in organic chemistry doing groundbreaking research in the hope of furthering my knowledge in the field. Only then I realized that while I still like learning chemistry and working in the lab, I have lost the passion that I once had for it. This coupled with several other factors made me reconsider pursuing a carrier in chemistry. But if not chemistry then what, I have been learning, training, and working as a chemist for 8 years at that point. It's the only thing I was qualified to do. 

After months of contemplation, I finally decided to leave my life as a chemist behind and do something different. Then it occured to me that occasionally when I visit some website I get annoyed when its missing something that I was looking for or its not showing it properly. I always thought I could do a better job if only I know how to do it.

Fast forward to now and here I am learning ruby and about to program my first ruby gem. I guess what I'm trying to is as long as you're willing to learn, anyone can be a developer regardless of their background.
